Find the instructions and rubric in [Instructions.md](Instructions.md)

## Checklist:

- [x] All of my code is pushed up into a repository.
- [x] Fill out the `How to test the Application` section
- [x] The technical write-up of the web storage selection is below.
- [x] Fill out the self-evaluation form.
- [x] Submit the repository link and list of group members, if applicable, to Canvas.

## How to test the Application:

* Where and how is web storage used?
The application is used to store and save the username in the local storage, and the game score and history in the session storage.
* What are application use cases?
One use case is to type your name into the name textbox then hit start game. Then select your choice of rock papers or scissors. Hit go and you will get your result. Do it a couple more times then refresh the page. If the storage works the name should be saved along with the previous score and game history, the history will reset once you play again.

## Technical Write-up of selection of web storage solution:
I decided to use the local storage for the username so it stays even when you close the tab. I also used session storage for the score and game history so you don't lose it when you refresh the page but it doesn't when you close the tab.

## Self Reflection(s):
Overall it was just trying to fit the web storage into the program. I understand how to use it its just applying it into a program I already wrote was a little difficult

## How long it took me/us to finish this:
4 hours
